# CLIVideoPlayer

Simple CLI Video Player (without audio for now)

It started as an internal joke but also evolved quite a bit, i tried my best to optimize the code but i still didn't got it fast enough to play hq videos at a decent speed.

Update, i keep trying to optimize it once and again and actually it's probably fast enough to play videos on hd

I don't think i can top up this amount of optimization again tho i even surprised myself this time

## How to use

Compile and drag any video file into the executable

## To do

* Add a way to select the render resolution in the launching arguments

## Done

* Fix playback speed
* More Intermediate Grey Tones (it has colors now)
* Multithread Decoding => Oh man, that's harder than it sounds

## Contact

If you need anything, just open an issue or dm me anywhere =)
