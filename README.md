# CLIVideoPlayer

Simple CLI Video Player (without audio for now)

It started as an internal joke but also evolved quite a bit, i tried my best to optimize the code but i still didn't got it fast enough to play hq videos at a decent speed.

## How to use

Compile and drag any video file into the executable

## To do

* Add a way to select the render resolution in the launching arguments
* More Intermediate Grey Tones
* Multithread Decoding => Oh man, that's harder than it sounds

## Done

* Fix playback speed
